A biological model that animates life-cycles, reproduction, and deterioration of a population. This project
 can be used for future roles in determining what features are needed for population growth (or development in any sense).

Animation showing a field, populated with rabbits (blue circles) and foxes (red circles). As rabbits eat grass
and foxes hunt rabbits, the three species' population will fluctuate. User may parse the terminal to change starting
population and grass growth rate, to witness the impact of different features.

Once 1000 generations have existed, a bar chart of each population count will be made.
